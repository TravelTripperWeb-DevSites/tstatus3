But this classic venue isn’t resting on its laurels. As is standard practice in our metropolis-in-motion, New York City’s performing arts scene is evolving to suit an audience with increasingly diverse tastes in entertainment.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe city’s spring calendar of events goes beyond chamber music and classical recitals to span an array of genres and media. From Kronos Quartet’s 21st century take on traditional string music to Bjӧrk’s acclaimed queen-of-quirk stage show to an assortment of family-focused acts, Carnegie Hall and other Midtown venues are expanding their range this spring. It was a tough task, but we distilled the city’s spring performing arts calendar to feature a few of our favorites.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCarnegie Hall is only a brief one-block walk away from WestHouse Hotel.

New York City Center hosts several of the genre-shattering star’s NYC appearances this March. The matinee shows will focus on material from the artist’s new album, <i>Vulnicura</i>. Tickets are already tough to come by via standard channels. StubHub.com is the best place to find Bjӧrk tickets in NYC at this point.\r\n\r\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - <i>Bjork at MoMA<br></i></h3>\r\n<br><br>If you’re a Bjork fan in New York City this March, you’re in luck. In addition to her set of shows at Carnegie Hall and City Center, the singer is the subject of a career-spanning retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition includes instruments used on her <i>Biophilia</i> album, some of the singer’s most famous visuals and costumes, and a presentation of the singer’s groundbreaking music videos.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2015/3/7/1200/PM/Bjork/\" id=\"mfa23\">\r\nFind out more about Bjӧrk’s upcoming shows in New York City</a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Meredith Monk &amp; Friends - March 22, 2015 + May 2, 2015<br><br></h3>\r\n<br>She’s worked with luminaries as diverse as John Zorn and DJ Spooky, and Meredith Monk is coming to Carnegie Hall for an artist-in-residence series that crosses the boundaries of classical, pop and avant-garde. Local musicians, including nu-classical standouts Bang on a Can All-Stars, will accompany Monk at each of her Carnegie Hall appearances. On March 22, Monk and the ensemble will perform a remix-heavy set of Monk’s most forward-thinking selections. Her return to the venue on May 2 will focus on classics from her five-decade career, performed alongside a vocal ensemble.\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - <i>Kajitsu</i></h3>\r\n<br><br>You can find world-class Tsukiji-sourced fish at many a Manhattan sushi joint. But those high-end spots don’t necessarily best Kajitsu when it comes to encompassing the breadth of Japanese cuisine. The restaurant’s tasting menu changes monthly, showcasing delicacies not often found stateside such as Takiawase: lotus roots, burdock roots, tofu, nameko mushrooms, carrot, mizuna green, and chickpea. Kajitsu’s expansive menu mirrors Monk’s catalog by paying respect to tradition with one foot planted firmly in the future.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/monk/events/\" id=\"mfa24\">Learn more about Meredith Monk’s upcoming appearances at Carnegie Hall</a>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Music of David Byrne &amp; Talking Heads - March 23, 2015</h3>\r\n<br><br>This benefit concert (for Music Education Programs Serving Underprivileged Youth) showcases the best songs of David Byrne and Talking Heads, performed by an array of popular musicians. The lineup includes a smorgasbord of styles and genres, with musicians such as CeeLo Green, Glen Hansard, Esperanza Spalding, Santigold, O.A.R., and many others.\r\n\r\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - <i>Porchlight Bar</i></h3>\r\n<br><br>If you’re the type who likes their concert lineups varied and their drink menus diverse, visit Porchlight after the David Byrne concert and enjoy Danny Meyer’s newest dining destination. The new spirits-beer-wine-and-food emporium on the west side serves snacks like beef jerky and drinks covering a broad spectrum of price points: Think cans of Narragansett, fingers of Glenmorangie 18-year, and $9 glasses of Riesling. The bar’s down-home, southern style doesn’t have much in common with the new wave stylings of Talking Heads, but its expansive menu evokes Byrne’s diverse discography.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2015/3/23/0800/PM/The-Music-of-David-Byrne-Talking-Heads/\" id=\"mfa25\">More information on the David Byrne &amp; Talking Heads benefit show at Carnegie Hall</a>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>USA-Japan Goodwill Concert - April 6, 2015</h3>\r\n<br><br>Musicians from either side of the Pacific come together at Carnegie Hall in early April for a celebration of U.S.-Japanese relations and the countries’ shared musical heritage. Japanese choral groups such as the Goshiki Sakura Chorus and Kinboukai will perform alongside choral collections from Westchester, Baltimore, and Harrisburg —&nbsp;singing a mix of traditional Japanese music and pop music.\r\n\r\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - <i>“Discovering Japanese Art: American Collectors and the Met” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art<br><br></i></h3>\r\nDive deeper into the art and culture of Japan —&nbsp;and its influence in modern America — by viewing the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s vast collection of Japanese art. The museum’s comprehensive collection includes 200 masterworks from a variety of media, ranging from 1880s decorative pieces to world-renowned &nbsp;paintings like <i>Great Wave</i> and <i>Morning Glories</i>. If you’re looking for a place to relax between the exhibition and the concert, the Met’s Japanese Tea Garden provides a calming respite from the bustle of the city.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2015/3/7/0900/PM/Kronos-Quartet/\" id=\"mfa26\">Learn more about the USA-Japan Goodwill Concert</a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Carnegie Kids: Songs for Unusual Creatures - May 17, 2015<br><br></h3><p style=\"\" id=\"mf157\">Carnegie Hall isn’t all about buttoned-up classical music concerts and indie music showcases: the venue makes room on the calendar for kids, too -- or as we at WestHouse like to call them, “<a href=\"/?p=345\" id=\"mfa27\">Little Residents</a></p>.” This Sunday matinee musical event focuses on an array of bizarre beasts, including giant Chinese salamanders, elephant shrews, and other unique animals: all portrayed with fun — and dancing — in mind.\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - Carnegie Deli</h3>\r\n<br><br>This midtown diner offers a family-friendly taste of traditional NYC fare without requiring a trek to the outer boroughs. It’s within walking distance of Carnegie Hall, it offers breakfast all day in true diner style, and its decor offers a virtual window into New York City’s yesteryear. Enjoy a truly classic taste of New York City: a pastrami sandwich, piled high with enough meat to justify the $29.99 price tag.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2015/5/17/0200/PM/Carnegie-Kids-Songs-for-Unusual-Creatures/\" id=\"mfa28\">Learn more about the upcoming Carnegie Kids program</a>\r\n\r\n","image":null,"image_id":"2862","_delete_image":"0","author":"Blog Author","category_id":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029","55a40b1d28f55f08a900002b"],"date":"3/16/2015","author_id":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","seo_title":"WestHouse Itineraries: 5 Perfect NYC Excursions  | WestHouse Hotel New York","seo_description":"Carnegie Hall is woven tightly into the fabric of New York City, standing as a tradition-rich venue in the heart of Midtown Manhattan.
