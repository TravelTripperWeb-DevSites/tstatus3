When the temperature rises, WestHouse Hotel guests start to drift toward the beautiful terrace on the 23rd floor, where there’s cocktails, bar snacks and mind-blowing views of the city. It got us thinking...where else can city dwellers and visitors go to experience the city from above? Read on for our neighborhood guide to NYC’s 8 best rooftop bars!\r\n<br><br><h3>\r\nFLATIRON\r\n</h3><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.230-fifth.com/\" title=\"230 Fifth\" id=\"mfa17\" target=\"_blank\">230 Fifth</a>\r\n230 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10001; 212-725-4300\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Best iconic NYC view:</strong> Park yourself on one of the wooden benches under a big yellow and white umbrella on this 22,000-square foot rooftop garden and bar to check out the Empire State, MetLife and Chrysler buildings while the sun sets.\r\n<br><strong>Signature drink:</strong> Try the mojito with gin, cucumbers and a generous handful of muddled mint.\r\n<br><strong>Bar snack:</strong> Maine lobster rolls spritzed with sweet-tart Meyer lemon.\r\n<br><br><h3>\r\nLOWER EAST SIDE</h3><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thedl-nyc.com/\" title=\"The DL\" id=\"mfa18\" target=\"_blank\">The DL</a> (Dinner on Ludlow)\r\n<br>95 Delancey Street, New York, NY 10002; 212-228-0909\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Best downtown views and people watching:</strong> With its retractable roof, the outdoor patio of this multi-floor club presents a new perspective on the Lower East Side, and amazing views of the Williamsburg Bridge rain or shine.\r\n<br><strong>Signature drink:</strong> The super-refreshing cucumber martini goes down almost too smoothly.\r\n<br><strong>Bar snack:</strong> Food isn’t served on the rooftop, but downstairs is a delicious whole roasted sea bass at the restaurant Dinner on Ludlow.\r\n<br><br><h3>\r\nMEATPACKING DISTRICT\r\n</h3><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://whitney.org/Visit/Cafe\" title=\"Studio Café\" id=\"mfa19\" target=\"_blank\">Studio Cafe</a> at the Whitney Museum of American Art\r\n<br>99 Gansevoort Street, New York, NY 10014; 212-570-3670\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Best view of the Hudson:</strong> The Whitney Museum’s new downtown location includes 13,000 square feet of terraces and balconies, and you’ll want to make the most of your $22 day pass by visiting the rooftop terrace decorated with sculptures by David Smith. Plus, the museum is open until 10 p.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, which means you’ll be able to take in the sunset.\r\n<br><strong>Signature drink:</strong> The Untitled Lemonade is spiked with a healthy dose of bourbon and freshly muddled mint.\r\n<br><strong>Bar snack:</strong> Open-faced fennel-cured arctic char sandwich with fingerling potatoes and capers from chef Michael Anthony and chef de cuisine Suzanne Cupps (both of Gramercy Tavern fame).\r\n<br><br><h3>\r\nMIDTOWN EAST\r\n</h3><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit/dining-at-the-museum/roof-garden-cafe-and-martini-bar\" id=\"mfa20\" target=\"_blank\">Rooftop Martini Bar</a> at The Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n<br>1000 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10028; 212-535-7710\r\n<br>\r\n<strong><br>Most artistic view:</strong>&nbsp;The Met’s roof garden and martini bar has unbeatable views of Central Park, the West Side and Midtown. This year, visitors can check out an unusual series of archaeological installations from French artist Pierre Huyghe.\r\n<br><strong>Signature drink:</strong> The Smoke and Fire, an ancho chile limeade with Montelobos Mezcal Joven.\r\n<br><strong>Bar snack:</strong> Three Sisters salad with grilled corn, baby zucchini, walnuts, sumac and a sunflower seed vinaigrette.\r\n<br><br><h3>\r\nMIDTOWN WEST\r\n</h3><br>\r\n<a href=\"/?page_id=125\" id=\"mfa21\" target=\"_blank\">The Terrace</a> at WestHouse Hotel New York\r\n<br>201 W. 55th Street, New York, NY 10019; 212-707-4888\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Best private city retreat with a view:</strong> Perched atop the 23rd floor amid the Midtown West buildings, The Terrace reveals panoramic views of the cityscape and Hudson River. The private enclave is basically the outdoor space you wish every New York apartment had. It’s a coveted home away from home for hotel guests to take welcome breaks from the bustling city below under an oversized umbrella in the afternoon or by candlelight in the evening.\r\n<br><strong>Signature drink:</strong> “<a href=\"/?p=1843\" id=\"mfa22\" target=\"_blank\">Oldie but Goodie</a>,” a spin on the classic Old Fashioned with Solbeso and 18.21 Bitters.\r\n<br><strong>Bar snack</strong>: Eat breakfast al fresco, or swing by later in the day for tea service. Trust us, the house made pastries and cookies are just as great as the view.\r\n<br><br><h3>\r\nTIMES SQUARE\r\n</h3><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://theknickerbocker.com/dine/st-cloud/\" title=\"St. Cloud\" id=\"mfa23\" target=\"_blank\">St. Cloud</a> <br>6 Times Square, New York, NY 10036;&nbsp;212-204-4980\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Best pre/post-theater views:</strong>&nbsp;See all the lights of Times Square from this just-opened rooftop bar.&nbsp;Reserve one of the three corner \"sky pods\" for the best views. The newcomer on the block, expect a see-and-be-seen sort of crowd.\r\n<br><strong>Signature drink:</strong>&nbsp;A martini—The Knickerbocker hotel's bartender famously invented the drink back in 1912.\r\n<br><strong>Bar snack:</strong>&nbsp;The Cuban sandwich. What better way to fill up before a Broadway show than with this meaty sandwich from&nbsp;James Beard Award-winning chef Charlie Palmer?\r\n<br><br><h3>\r\nUNION SQUARE\r\n</h3><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bar13.com/\" id=\"mfa24\" target=\"_blank\">Bar 13</a>\r\n<br>35 E. 13th Street, New York, NY 10003; 212-979-6677\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Best view of an under-30 crowd:</strong> With open mic poetry readings on Mondays and DJ dance parties well into the weekend mornings, three-level lounge/nightclub Bar 13 attracts a Millennial crowd on its newly renovated, spacious roof deck.\r\n<br><strong>Signature drink:</strong> A frozen margarita during happy hour from 4 to 8 p.m. Ask for a mix of strawberry and lemon-lime flavors.\r\n<br><strong>Bar snack:</strong> Pulled BBQ chicken or pork sliders.\r\n<br><br><h3>\r\nWILLIAMSBURG\r\n</h3><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://berryparkbk.com/\" id=\"mfa25\" target=\"_blank\">Berry Park</a>\r\n<br>4 Berry Street, Brooklyn, NY 11211; 718-782-2829\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Most laidback rooftop:</strong> Take in the summer breeze and the sweeping view of the Manhattan skyline from this 3,000-square-foot roof deck across the East River.\r\n<br><strong>Signature drink:</strong> Brews like the Weihenstephan, a German wheat beer from the world’s oldest brewery, pair well with soccer (football, that is) on the big screen. They host a happy hour with $5 drink specials Monday through Friday from 2 to 5 p.m.\r\n<br><strong>Bar snack:</strong> With an assortment of knackwurst, cheddar bratwurst, sauerkraut, spicy mustard, and a pretzel roll, the large sausage platter is big enough to feed your crowd—and share with others.\r\n<br><br>\r\nReady to raise the bar with your next NYC experience this summer?
