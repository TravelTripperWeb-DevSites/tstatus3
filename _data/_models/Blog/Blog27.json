Whites wines aged in oak, such as Marsanne based or Viognier, are a good pairing. If you are looking for a red, try a light earthy wine like Beaujolais from France or Dolcetto d'Alba from Italy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">At dinners, keep it classic with pinot noir</span></span></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">&ldquo;When looking for a traditional wine to pair with your holiday meal, pinot noir from Oregon or California are the usual suspects.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">Or buck tradition with a vintage port</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">Vintage ports are amazing with gravy and all the sauces that are served along the main dish.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">Pair bubbles with dessert</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">&ldquo;With sweets, bubbles are great! Sparkling rose offers a great acidity and a nice fizz.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">Look for something rich&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">Steer clear of light, crisp wines. They aren&rsquo;t generally rich enough to pair with holiday meals.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">When in doubt...go for champagne</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">&ldquo;Champagne is synonymous with celebration!&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">Want to learn more about wine?
