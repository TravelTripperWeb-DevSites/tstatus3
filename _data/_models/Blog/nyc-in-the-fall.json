We head to The Terrace right here at WestHouse, or walk to the nearby <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/things-to-do-in-nyc/culinary-guide/coffee-and-drinks/\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Blue Bottle</span></a> for New Orleans-style coffee.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #222222; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Getting a sneak peek at rarely-seen rooms of famous New York buildings at</span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.ohny.org/weekend/overview\"> <span style=\"color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Open House New York Weekend</span></a> (Oct. 15 and 16). Last year, we stepped inside Google&rsquo;s Chelsea offices and hidden rooms of City Hall. Details of this year&rsquo;s buildings are still under wraps.</li>\n<li><img src=\"http://cdn.traveltripper.io/assets/9102/original/Lincoln-Center-in-New-York-City.jpg\" /></li>\n<li>Spending an evening at the <a href=\"http://www.metopera.org/\">Metropolitan Opera</a>. Expect classics like Puccini's La Boh&egrave;me and Verdi's Otello early on in the season, and, for the first time in a century, Bizet&rsquo;s Les P&ecirc;cheurs de Perles before the new year. (You know it for its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-rDRa-5h4s&amp;t=2m12s\">famous duet</a>.)</li>\n<li>Eating our way through <a href=\"http://nycwff.org/\">New York Wine &amp; Food Festival</a> (Oct. 15-18). Food &amp; Wine magazine presents this four-day festival along with Food Network and the Cooking Channel, so expect big names like Mario Batali, Giada de Laurentiis and Marcus Samuelsson.</li>\n<li>Seeing the foliage in Central Park (or <a href=\"http://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/blog/manhattans-best-picnic-spots\">anywhere else we can have a picnic</a>). The reds and yellows of the leaves, set against the Manhattan skyline and a crisp blue sky make this one of the most beautiful (read: Instagrammable) times of year.<br /><img src=\"http://cdn.traveltripper.io/assets/9112/original/apple-crumble.jpg\" width=\"996\" height=\"664\" /></li>\n<li>Ordering off fall menus at restaurants. Acorn and butternut squashes are back on the table, and apple crisps and cobblers are sweetening dessert menus. We're excited to head downtown and try <a class=\"\" href=\"http://www.rebellenyc.com/menus/\">Rebelle'</a>s scallops with turnip and apple from chef Daniel Eddy, who recently helped earn this French restaurant a Michelin star.</li>\n<li>Hearing world-class music at Carnegie Hall. The New York Philharmonic&rsquo;s home stage is opening its 125th season this October.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li>\n</ul>","definition":"","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029"],"image":{"url":"/assets/images/9042/original/NYC_Fall_2.jpg"}}
