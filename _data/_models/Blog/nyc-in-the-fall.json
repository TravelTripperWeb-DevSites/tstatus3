But the harvest season brings its own charms to the Big Apple. Here are a few reasons why we love New York City in the fall:</p><div><p><br></p></div><ul><li>Drinking hot tea and coffee. A chill in the air means that it’s officially time to switch from iced to spiced. We head to The Terrace or the Den right here at WestHouse, or walk to the nearby <a href=\"http://www.zibettoespresso.com/\">Zibetto Espresso Bar</a> for an Italian-style cafe experience—the cappuccino here packs a serious caffeine punch.</li><li>Getting a sneak peek at rarely-seen rooms of famous New York buildings at <a href=\"http://www.ohny.org/weekend/overview\">Open House New York Weekend</a> (Oct. 17 and 18). This year, we can’t wait to step inside Google’s Chelsea offices and hidden rooms of City Hall.<br><img src=\"http://cdn.traveltripper.io/assets/9102/original/Lincoln-Center-in-New-York-City.jpg\"><br></li><li>Spending an evening at the <a href=\"http://www.metopera.org/\">Metropolitan Opera</a>. Expect classics like Puccini's La Bohème and Verdi's Otello early on in the season, and, for the first time in a century, Bizet’s Les Pêcheurs de Perles before the new year. (You know it for its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-rDRa-5h4s&amp;t=2m12s\">famous duet</a>.)</li><li>Eating our way through <a href=\"http://nycwff.org/\">New York Wine &amp; Food Festival</a> (Oct. 15-18). Food &amp; Wine magazine presents this four-day festival along with Food Network and the Cooking Channel, so expect big names like Mario Batali, Giada de Laurentiis and Marcus Samuelsson.</li><li>Seeing the foliage in Central Park (or <a href=\"http://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/blog/manhattans-best-picnic-spots\">anywhere else we can have a picnic</a>). The reds and yellows of the leaves, set against the Manhattan skyline and a crisp blue sky make this one of the most beautiful (read: Instagrammable) times of year.<br><img height=\"664\" src=\"http://cdn.traveltripper.io/assets/9112/original/apple-crumble.jpg\" width=\"996\"><br></li><li>Ordering off fall menus at restaurants. Acorn and butternut squashes are back on the table, and apple crisps and cobblers are sweetening dessert menus. We're excited to head downtown and try <a href=\"http://www.rebellenyc.com/menus/\" class=\"\">Rebelle'</a>s scallops with turnip and apple from chef Daniel Eddy, who recently helped earn this French restaurant a Michelin star.</li><li>Hearing world-class music at Carnegie Hall. The New York Philharmonic’s home stage is opening its 125th season this October.<br><br><br><br><br><br></li></ul>","definition":"","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029"],"image":{"url":"/images/assets/9042/original/NYC_Fall_2.jpg"}}
