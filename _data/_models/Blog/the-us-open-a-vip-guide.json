We pulled together the best ways to see the matches like an A-lister.</p><h3>Skip the subway.</h3><p><br>Why deal with the crowds and transfers of subway travel when you can reserve luxury car service? Your WestHouse concierges will be happy to arrange private transportation to Arthur Ashe stadium in Queens.</p><h3>Get the right seat.</h3><p><br>Forego the nosebleed seats and watch the volleys from a courtside seat, or from the slightly higher in the loge section. Not only are the views better and your chances of sitting next to celebrities higher in these two sections, but you&rsquo;ll also have exclusive access to top-tier dining.</p><h3>Eat well.</h3><p><br>Most match spectators will eat at the Food Village, one of several venues with restaurants in the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. For exclusive fine dining, loge and promenade ticket holders can reserve a table at Aces, Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto&rsquo;s and local darling Ed White&rsquo;s high-end sushi restaurant (with a knockout wine list to boot).</p><h3>Meet the players.</h3><p><br></p><p>How?&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.premiertennis.com/\" id=\"mfa17\">Premier Tennis</a>&nbsp;can organize private gatherings with elite players. Attend a lunch, a meet-and-greet or even a practice round with your favorite tennis star, while everyone else settles for seeing them from the stands.<br><br></p><h3>Reserve a Luxury Suite package.</h3><p><br>For your own personal Grand Slam, book a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://usta.usopen.org/US-Open/luxury_suite_packages/\" id=\"mfa18\">Luxury Suite package</a>. Box suites for twenty, parking passes, gourmet catering, and player appearances make these packages worth itâ€”if you have upwards of $12,000 to spare.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\" id=\"mf126\"><br></p><p>Photo from Wally Gobetz&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/239654105/in/photolist-nbhPk-Bzbgm-mNHk1-oW4myF-oSUV7C-oRiRh9-oSNXtx-mNHjL-mNHkh-mNHcy-fF3k9P-nb7jf-8yHpXQ-8zm4Qd-8yEvkF-8A7YZw-8BBUYL-2hC1W-5hP8YX-8A4PxF-oAR9Ri-oRiiFy-5hP9PX-5hTxiA-5hTueh-5hP7iT-5hTuzm-5hP9oH-fTZsyK-378ymg-p3mn6y-p37KMT-p29LcT-p3odNv-xXvhG-oKMQpF-oW4pNB-fTZrBz-4KkPq-6Wi1xr-75vznN-75rH3p-8yHHm7-8yHHwb-cWHCaf-8ByNK4-5WtZZZ-8w5adQ-8w27Bi-FMpGS\" id=\"mfa19\">Flickr</a>.</p>","definition":"","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029"]}
