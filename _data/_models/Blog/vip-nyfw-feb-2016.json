Attracting as much star power and exclusivity as the Met Gala, NYFW has become famously off-limits for the general public. Read on for tips to gain VIP access to New York Fashion Week. <i>Photo courtesy of New York Fashion Week <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/93quz6NhIU/?taken-by=nyfw\" class=\"\">on Instagram</a>.</i></p><p><br></p><h2>LOOK IN YOUR WALLET</h2><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;\">American Express cardholders will have access to a private members lounge throughout NYFW, giving them backstage passes to runway shows at the lounge’s Milk Studios location. Amex Platinum and Centurion cardholders will get access this year’s Zac Posen show, where they will sit with the press for one of the industry’s most prolific designers. As part of the VIP package, they’ll have backstage access, including a meet and greet with the Posen himself. </p><p><br></p><h2>NAB SEATS TO A PUBLIC SHOW</h2><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;\">Most shows that are <a href=\"http://fashionweekonline.com/new-york/tickets\" class=\"\">open to the public</a> are, in the words of top <a href=\"http://www.susanjoy.net/\" class=\"\">stylist Susan Joy</a>, “not the ones fashion editors care about.” Meaning, they’re neither newsy nor influential...yet. “You never know,” Joy says. “Maybe those unknowns become someone, and you can say you were at their first show!” </p><p><br></p><h2>ATTEND THE CHARITY SHOW</h2><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;\">As for where to see celebrities, Joy recommends the charity show, which is open to the public but can draw a high-profile crowd. This year’s is on the 16th at 7pm, in Chelsea’s Highline Ballroom, and proceeds go to the <a href=\"http://georgiebadielfoundation.org/\">Georgie Badiel Foundation</a>. Reserve VIP tickets for front-of-the-line admission and access to a private room. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nyfw-fashion-for-charity-w-open-bar-hosted-by-miss-world-america-2015-tickets-20419985727\">&nbsp;<i>Tickets available here</i></a>. </p><p><br></p><h2>SPLURGE AT YOUR FAVORITE DESIGNER STORE</h2><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;\">Some designers give their top customers tickets to their shows, says Joy. If you’re a loyal shopper, and you’re considering a big-ticket purchase, now’s the time to do it. </p><p><br></p><h2>WAIT FOR NEXT YEAR</h2><p>There are a lot of changes coming to New York Fashion Week. Journalists are overwhelmed by the massive number of events; consumers are frustrated that most runway shows are impossible to see—and display clothes that won’t be available till next season. NYFW has hired Boston Consulting Group to explore the relevance of fashion week in its current form and “create an in-depth analysis and roadmap for the future of fashion shows,” said Steven Kolb, President and CEO of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.<br></p>","definition":"","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029"]}
