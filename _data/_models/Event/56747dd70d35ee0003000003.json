This year, expect big name performers like Ellie Goulding, Jimmy Buffet, Whiz Kalifa, Demi Lovato, Walk the Moon and and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis during Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve with Ryan Seacrest. One of the city&rsquo;s most famous events, it&rsquo;s also recommended only for the brave. Cold temperatures are common, and there are no restrooms within the closed off streets of Times Square. For anyone hoping for a good view, plan to arrive before noon on Dec. 31.</p><p><br>For more information, visit the Times Square Alliance website <a href=\"http://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/new-years-eve/nye-schedule/index.aspx#.VnR7uRorLwd\" class=\"\">here</a>.<br></p>","definition":""}
