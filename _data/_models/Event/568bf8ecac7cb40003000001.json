Last performed at the Met by Enrico Caruso in 1916, the three-part-opera tells the dramatic tale of two best friends who fall in love with the same woman. While few opera-goers will know most of its beautifully melodic score, most will recognize the famed “Au fond du temple saint,” Bizet’s gorgeous duet which has become one of the opera world’s most famous and oft-performed pieces. This production, stars tenor Matthew Polenzani and baritone Mariusz Kwiecien as the two pearl fishers pursuing Hindu priestess Leïla, played by soprano Diana Damrau. The New York Times hails the “dream cast” for its creating “theatrical magic.”</p><p><br>For more information and tickets, visit <a href=\"http://www.metopera.org/Season/2015-16-Season/pecheurs-de-perles-bizet-tickets/\" class=\"\">the Metropolitan Opera website</a>.<br></p>","definition":""}
