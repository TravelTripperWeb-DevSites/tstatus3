Some of Stella’s best known works are on display, alongside lesser known pieces from museums around the world. The exhibition is the most comprehensive look at Stella’s career to date, and is co-organized by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Reopened just a few months ago, the Whitney has moved into a stunning new building in the Meatpacking District. </p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.755;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">For more information, visit the <a href=\"http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/FrankStella\" class=\"\">museum’s website</a>.</p><p><i>Photo courtesy of The Whitney Museum</i>.<br></p>","definition":""}
