Comprised of 35 paintings and 50 other works on paper, the exhibition explores how Munch’s use of color intensifies the subject matter’s emotional power, and how artists in the early twentieth century used his paintings—which often explored dark themes such as alienation and vulnerability—as inspiration. The Neue Galerie is housed inside an Art Nouveau mansion overlooking Central Park on Fifth Avenue, and is one of New York’s most intimate fine art experiences.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"line-height:1.755;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">For more information, visit the <a href=\"http://www.neuegalerie.org/content/munch-and-expressionism\">museum’s website</a>.</p><p>Photo by Hulya Kolabas for Neue Galerie, via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BAu4SUCsM-e/?taken-by=neuegalerieny\">@neuegalerie</a>.<br></p>","definition":""}
