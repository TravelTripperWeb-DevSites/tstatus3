Robert De Niro, along with investor Craig Hatkoff and film producer Jane Rosenthal, founded the festival in the aftermath of September 11th attacks to help revitalize the Tribeca neighborhood and to remind New Yorkers of their importance in the film industry. Nearly every screening at the ten-day festival is a North American or even world premiere, and oftentimes the director, cast and crew is available for Q&amp;A sessions after the film. While there is sometimes a local focus, films come from around the world, ensuring that audiences see a wide range of &nbsp;filmmaking perspectives.
