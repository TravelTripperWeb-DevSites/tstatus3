On Saturday and Sunday, April 30-May 1, &nbsp;taiko drumming, Japanese kabuki dance, martial arts shows, a tea ceremony and more will take over the 1910-built botanical garden. More than 200 cherry trees, planted after World War I, line the park&rsquo;s famous Cherry Esplanade and Cherry Walk, one of the world&rsquo;s top sakura-viewing sites outside of Japan.
