But few events are as iconic, or spectacular, as the New Year&rsquo;s Eve Party in Times Square. This public plaza has been the center of New Year&rsquo;s Eve for more than a century, since the first rooftop parties began in 1904. Today, as many as one million revelers brave the bitter cold&mdash;and long hours spent standing&mdash;for live musical performances (last year&rsquo;s event included Carrie Underwood, Jessie J, and Luke Bryan) and the epic countdown. The entire affair concludes as the Waterford crystal New Year&rsquo;s Eve Ball (a glittering sphere weighing 11,875 pounds) descends 70 feet in the final 60 seconds of the year.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-61b3bc6a-be03-af01-c74d-04f823cef217\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">For more information, and to watch the live countdown timer until the ball drop, visit </span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://timessquareball.net/\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">the official website</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> of the Times Square Ball Drop. </span></p>","preview":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">For hours leading up to the stroke of midnight on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, all of New York City is essentially one giant party.
